VOICE ISOLATOR - ERROR FIX SUMMARY
================================================================================

YOUR ERROR WAS:
  "Failed to start audio streams: Error opening Inputstream:Invalid Device [PaErrorCode-9996]"

CAUSE:
  Device ID in config.json was invalid or no longer available

WHAT I FIXED:
  1. Added device validation before trying to use them
  2. Improved error messages (tells you which device is wrong)
  3. Cleared the bad config.json (fresh start)
  4. Better device detection and display
  5. More robust error handling throughout

RESULT:
  The program now:
  ✓ Checks if devices exist before using them
  ✓ Shows clear error messages if something is wrong
  ✓ Auto-detects available devices on startup
  ✓ Lets you easily select from valid devices
  ✓ Saves settings only after successful start

TO USE THE FIXED VERSION:
  1. Run: python voice_isolator.py
  2. Select devices:
     - Microphone: [1] Microphone (Sound Blaster...)
     - Loopback: [15] Voicemeeter In 1 (...)
     - Output: [6] Speakers (Audioengine...)
  3. Click "Start Voice Isolation"
  4. If error, try different device combination
  5. When it works, sliders are active

NEW FILES ADDED:
  ✓ FIX_AND_RUN.txt ......... This session's quick start
  ✓ WHAT_WAS_FIXED.md ...... Details about the fix
  ✓ QUICK_REFERENCE.txt .... One-page reference card
  ✓ FIX_SUMMARY.txt ........ This file

KEY CHANGES IN voice_isolator.py:
  • Added validate_device() function
  • Better exception handling with clear messages
  • Device selection parsing shows device IDs
  • GUI auto-tries to select valid devices
  • Verbose console output for debugging

DEVICE SELECTION TIPS:
  Your Microphone (pick from):
    [1] Microphone (Sound Blaster Audigy 5/Rx)
    [3] Headset Microphone (Oculus Virt...)
    [13] Microphone (Sound Blaster Audigy 5/Rx)
    
  Speaker Loopback (pick from):
    [15] Voicemeeter In 1 (VB-Audio Voicemeeter VAIO)
    [42] Stereo Mix (Conexant HD...)
    [46] Voicemeeter Input (VB-Audio...)
    
  Output (pick any):
    [5] Microsoft Sound Mapper
    [6] Speakers (Audioengine HD3)
    Any speakers work

IF YOU STILL GET ERRORS:
  1. Run: python list_devices.py
  2. Find your microphone in the list
  3. Find a loopback device (marked with "LIKELY LOOPBACK")
  4. Find any speakers device
  5. Use the [ID] numbers to select in the GUI

NEXT STEP:
  Open: FIX_AND_RUN.txt and follow the steps

TESTING THE FIX:
  1. python voice_isolator.py
  2. Select devices from dropdowns
  3. Click "Start Voice Isolation"
  4. Status should show "RUNNING (GREEN LIGHT)"
  5. If not, read the error message and try different devices

SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE:
  • Button says "Stop Voice Isolation"
  • Status shows "RUNNING (GREEN LIGHT)"
  • Sliders are adjustable
  • No error messages

ENJOY YOUR CLEAN VOICE!
