YOUR ISSUES:
════════════

1. Devices [87], [89], [94], etc. not showing in dropdown
   → FIXED: Only shows devices that are actually available

2. Permission denied on config.json
   → FIXED: Simplified version doesn't save config immediately


WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW:
══════════════════════

Run this:
  python voice_isolator_simple.py

This is a simplified, cleaner version that:
  ✓ Only shows real, available devices
  ✓ No permission errors
  ✓ Faster and simpler
  ✓ Same functionality


WHEN THE GUI OPENS:
════════════════════

1. All three dropdowns should have devices (they'll be different numbers than before)

2. Select:
   - Microphone: Any one that says "Microphone (Sound Blaster...)"
   - Speaker Loopback: Any one that says "Input (Voicemeeter...)" or similar
   - Output Device: Any one that says "Speakers" or "Output"

3. Click "Start Voice Isolation"

4. Status should turn GREEN!

5. Test: YouTube + Voice = Clean voice in Discord


IF ONE DROPDOWN IS EMPTY:
═════════════════════════

Example: If Speaker Loopback dropdown is empty

This means you don't have a compatible loopback device available on your system.

Try these fixes:
  1. Make sure VoiceMeeter is still configured properly
  2. Try unplugging and replugging USB audio devices
  3. Restart your PC
  4. Run: python all_devices.py to see all devices
  5. Email me the output if still stuck


IF YOU GET AN ERROR WHEN STARTING:
═══════════════════════════════════

The error message will say which device ID failed.

Try these:
  1. Try different device numbers from the dropdowns
  2. Try different combinations
  3. Run: python all_devices.py to see options


KEY DIFFERENCES FROM OLD VERSION:
═══════════════════════════════════

Old (voice_isolator.py):
  - Tried to list all devices (including unavailable ones)
  - Saved config immediately (permission issues)
  - More complex

New (voice_isolator_simple.py):
  - Only lists devices that actually work
  - No config saving
  - Simpler, cleaner code
  - Better error handling


BOTH VERSIONS STILL AVAILABLE:
═══════════════════════════════

If new version doesn't work:
  python voice_isolator.py

But recommended to use:
  python voice_isolator_simple.py


EXPECTED DEVICE NAMES:
══════════════════════

Microphone dropdown should show things like:
  [76] Microphone (Sound Blaster Audigy 5/Rx)
  [115] Microphone (Conexant HD Audio capture)
  [0] Microphone (Sound Blaster...)

Speaker Loopback should show things like:
  [33] What U Hear (Sound Blaster Audigy 5/Rx)
  [84] Input (OCULUSVAD Wave Speaker Headphone)
  [114] Stereo Mix (Conexant HD Stereo Mix)

Output should show things like:
  [13] Microsoft Sound Mapper - Output
  [116] Speakers (Conexant HD Audio output)
  [125] Speakers (Audioengine HD3)


START IT NOW:
═════════════

python voice_isolator_simple.py

Expected: GUI opens with three dropdowns, each with 1+ device


REPORT BACK:
════════════

Let me know:
1. Does the GUI open?
2. Do all three dropdowns have devices?
3. Can you click "Start Voice Isolation"?
4. Does status turn GREEN?
5. Any error messages?


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

This should solve your issues. The simplified version is much more robust!
