THE REAL ISSUE:
════════════════

You were sending Voice Isolator OUTPUT to SPEAKERS:
  Your Voice → Voice Isolator → Speakers → You hear it!  (WRONG!)

What you actually need:
  Your Voice → Voice Isolator → Virtual Microphone → Discord (NOT speakers!)


THE FIX:
═════════

Change Voice Isolator OUTPUT to a VIRTUAL MICROPHONE

Available virtual microphones on your system:
  [46] Voicemeeter Input (VB-Audio Voicemeeter VAIO) ← OUTPUT device
  [49] Voicemeeter AUX Input (VB-Audio Voicemeeter VAIO) ← OUTPUT device
  [62] Voicemeeter AUX Input (VB-Audio Voicemeeter VAIO) ← OUTPUT device
  [69] Voicemeeter In 3 (VB-Audio Voicemeeter VAIO) ← OUTPUT device

(These are "OUTPUT" devices that act as VIRTUAL MICROPHONE inputs!)


HOW THIS WORKS:
════════════════

1. Your microphone input: [76] Microphone (Sound Blaster...)

2. Loopback/speaker audio: [33] "What U Hear" or [114] Stereo Mix

3. Voice Isolator processes: Voice - Speaker Audio = Clean Voice

4. Voice Isolator OUTPUT goes to: [46] Voicemeeter Input (VIRTUAL MIC!)
   (NOT to speakers!)

5. Discord/Game INPUT set to: [46] Voicemeeter Input

6. Result: Discord receives ONLY clean voice, NOT from speakers


THE AUDIO FLOW:
════════════════

┌─ Real Microphone [76]
│     ↓
│  Voice Isolator
│     ↓ (processes voice)
│  Output [46] Voicemeeter Input (VIRTUAL MICROPHONE)
│     ↓
│  Discord/Game listens to [46]
│     ↓
│  Teammates hear clean voice
│
├─ Your Speakers (play game audio ONLY)
│     ↓
│  Loopback [33] (captures what's playing)
│     ↓
│  Sent to Voice Isolator for subtraction
│
└─ NOT connected to speakers anymore! (No echo!)


STEP-BY-STEP SETUP:
════════════════════

STEP 1: Run Voice Isolator
  python voice_isolator_correct.py

STEP 2: Select devices:
  Microphone:       [76] Microphone (Sound Blaster Audigy 5/Rx)
  Loopback:         [33] "What U Hear" (Sound Blaster Audigy 5/Rx)
  Output:           [46] Voicemeeter Input ← VIRTUAL MIC, NOT SPEAKERS!

STEP 3: Click "Start Voice Isolation"
  Wait for GREEN "RUNNING"

STEP 4: Configure Discord
  1. Discord Settings → Voice & Video
  2. Microphone: [46] Voicemeeter Input
  3. Test microphone
  4. Should show audio when you speak
  5. Done!

STEP 5: Configure Your Game
  Game Settings → Audio/Voice
  Microphone: [46] Voicemeeter Input (or same as Discord)

STEP 6: Test
  1. Play game audio
  2. Speak into microphone
  3. Check yourself on Discord
  4. You should NOT hear your own voice through speakers
  5. Teammates SHOULD hear your clean voice
  6. Success!


VIRTUAL MICROPHONE OPTIONS:
══════════════════════════════

If [46] doesn't work, try these (in order):
  [46] Voicemeeter Input (VB-Audio Voicemeeter VAIO)
  [49] Voicemeeter AUX Input (VB-Audio Voicemeeter VAIO)
  [62] Voicemeeter AUX Input (VB-Audio Voicemeeter VAIO)
  [69] Voicemeeter In 3 (VB-Audio Voicemeeter VAIO)

All of these are "OUTPUT" devices that Discord can use as "INPUT" microphones!


LOOPBACK OPTIONS:
═══════════════════

For capturing game audio (unchanged from before):
  [33] "What U Hear" (Sound Blaster Audigy 5/Rx) ← TRY FIRST
  [114] Stereo Mix (Conexant HD Stereo Mix) ← TRY IF [33] FAILS


WHY THIS WORKS:
═════════════════

VoiceMeeter's virtual devices are bidirectional:
  - As OUTPUT: Software can send audio TO them
  - As INPUT: Discord can read audio FROM them

So when Voice Isolator sends clean voice to [46]:
  - It becomes available as a microphone for Discord
  - Discord reads it as if it's a real microphone
  - Your speakers never play it (no echo!)
  - Teammates receive the clean voice


TROUBLESHOOTING:
════════════════

Problem: Discord doesn't show [46] in microphone list
Solution:
  1. Close Discord completely
  2. Ensure Voice Isolator is running with [46] as output
  3. Restart Discord
  4. [46] should now appear in microphone list

Problem: [46] shows but no audio
Solution:
  1. Check Voice Isolator status is GREEN
  2. Speak into microphone
  3. Discord microphone test should show green bar
  4. If not: Try next virtual mic ([49], [62], [69])

Problem: Still hearing your voice through speakers
Solution:
  1. Double-check output is [46] (not [13] or [116])
  2. Make sure game audio is routed correctly
  3. Try different loopback: [114] instead of [33]


═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FINAL CONFIGURATION:
═════════════════════

Voice Isolator Settings:
  Microphone:       [76]
  Loopback:         [33] or [114]
  Output:           [46] Voicemeeter Input

Discord Settings:
  Microphone:       [46] Voicemeeter Input

Game Settings:
  Microphone:       [46] Voicemeeter Input


RESULT:
════════

✓ You don't hear yourself (no echo!)
✓ Teammates hear only your voice
✓ Game audio removed from your transmission
✓ Perfect gaming communication!


DO THIS NOW:

1. Run: python voice_isolator_correct.py

2. Change OUTPUT from [13] to [46]

3. Keep Mic [76] and Loopback [33] or [114]

4. Click Start → Wait for GREEN

5. Set Discord Microphone to [46]

6. Test and enjoy!
